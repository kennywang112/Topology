# Topology data analysis (TDA)

This repository includes basic uses of TDA methods in both R and Python. Real data applications using TDA are discussed here. In my subjective opinion, TDA is one of the most underrated analysis methods in data science, primarily because it is less frequently discussed on most analysis platforms and in research papers. I would like to keep updating this repository with more analyses using TDA and share basic concepts on Medium. You can find this information in my self-introduction. I hope to inspire more people to explore this fascinating method, and at the same time, I look forward to receiving feedback on my self-learning journey!
